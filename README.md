## My Process

I developed an e-commerce product page with a modern, responsive design. Key features include a dynamic image slider, a cart management system with persistent storage, and interactive elements for a seamless user experience.

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup:** Structured the page using modern HTML elements for better accessibility and readability.
- **SCSS:** Used SCSS for enhanced styling capabilities, including variables, nesting, and mixins for maintainable and scalable CSS.
- **CSS Custom Properties:** Employed CSS variables for consistent styling and easier theming.
- **Flexbox & Grid:** Applied for layout and alignment, ensuring a responsive design across different devices.
- **JavaScript:** Managed dynamic elements including sliders, cart updates, and persistent data handling.
- **Local Storage:** Used `localStorage` to save and retrieve cart information.

### What I Learned

This project enhanced my skills in:

- **SCSS:** Leveraging SCSS features like variables, mixins, and nesting for more efficient and organized CSS.
- **JavaScript Event Handling:** Implementing functionality for sliders and cart interactions.
- **Responsive Design:** Utilizing CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Performance Optimization:** Using lazy loading for images and managing local storage for improved performance.
- **Data Persistence:** Leveraging `localStorage` to maintain cart state across page reloads.

### Continued Development

Future improvements will focus on:

- **Advanced JavaScript Features:** Adding more interactive elements and improving user interaction handling.
- **CSS Animations:** Exploring advanced animations for a more engaging user interface.
- **Accessibility Enhancements:** Ensuring that all interactive components are fully accessible to users with diverse needs.
